    Pasteurization (used for whole milk) is a treatment that involves exposing raw milk to a high temperature
    for a short period of time (at least +71.7Â°C for 15 seconds, or any other equivalent combination).

    Let's assume the existence of a sensor that measures the temperature twice per second. The temperature has a 99% chance
    of being at least the specified temperature, and a 1% chance of being below the specified temperature.
